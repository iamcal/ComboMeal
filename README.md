# ComboMeal - Rotation timers for combat rogues

An addon for monitoring combo-point abilities and cooldowns for raiding combat rogues.

The top row shows your active rotation abilities. Glowing border means right now, active icon means up next.

The second row shows your current combo points. Green are on your target, yellow are on a previous target (so can be used for SnD, Recuperate or Redirect).

The third row shows your main cooldowns (Adrenaline Rush and Killing Spree) and your Blade Flurry state. KS will be dimmed when it's not sensible to use it (when AR is ready or active, or when you have too much energy).

The fourth row shows profession and racial cooldowns and any on-use trinkets.


These icons are _not_ ability buttons - they cannot be clicked. Set up your keybinds however you normally would - this addon is just to help you monitor rotation and cooldowns.
